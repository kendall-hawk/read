00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,160
Hello, this is 6 Minute English
from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,440
And I'm Beth.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,320
Do you enjoy eating noodles, Beth?

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,840
I love noodles, yes.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,120
I think my favourite are udon –
the big thick ones.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,400
Mmm, they're so good!

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,120
Well, some people buy them dried
in a packet,

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,360
others make them fresh
from wheat or rice,

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,560
but there is little doubt that
noodles are popular around the world.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,000
From their origins,
probably somewhere in China,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,640
noodle recipes were spread by traders
on the ancient Silk Road.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,960
At each destination along the road,
people gave noodles a twist,

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,000
adding different flavours
and ingredients to create a new dish.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,800
In this programme, we'll visit
the United States and Japan,

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,680
two countries which have taken noodles
and created exciting new varieties.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,520
As usual, we'll learn
some useful new vocabulary

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,400
and remember – you can read along
with the transcript of this programme,

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,240
available now on our website,

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,080
But first,
Neil, I have a question for you.

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,680
As well as different shapes
and ingredients,

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,720
noodles come
in many different flavours.

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,880
So, which region of China is famous
for its spicy flavours?

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,200
Is it: a) Shanghai, b) Sichuan,
or c) Guangzhou?

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,080
Well, I think actually,
Beth, I know the answer to this.

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,280
I've been lucky enough to have been
to this place.

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,560
I think it's b) Sichuan.

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,360
OK. Well, you sound confident.

28
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,520
I will reveal the answer later
in the programme.

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,480
BBC World Service programme,
The Food Chain,

30
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,880
investigated how noodles spread
from Asia through Europe to America.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,480
They uncovered a surprising story
that pasta comes

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,920
from noodles brought back to Italy
by Marco Polo in the 13th century.

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,160
Jen Lin-Liu, author of the book,

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,840
On the Noodle Road,
doesn't believe this story.

35
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,240
So, noodles were very exotic in the
1920s and 30s in the United States,

36
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,960
and there was a new
pasta association in America

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,880
that wanted to promote
the manufacturing of dried pasta.

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,880
And so they came up with a story

39
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,880
about how Marco Polo went to China

40
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,000
and found the noodle there,

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,120
and brought it all the way to Italy.

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,000
In the 1920s, noodles were popular
because they were exotic,

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,120
meaning foreign,
unusual and exciting.

44
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,040
At that time, pasta companies were
promoting a new invention, dried pasta,

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,880
so they came up with a story
about Marco Polo to sell more pasta.

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,800
If you come up with something
you suggest or think up an idea.

47
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,280
And it worked –
sales of pasta jumped as a result!

48
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,960
Now, our second destination, Japan,
also has a history of eating noodles.

49
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,960
One of the most famous
Japanese noodle dishes is ramen,

50
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,880
and Frank Striegl, a blogger living
in Tokyo, knows all about it.

51
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,880
He eats over 300 bowls
of ramen a year!

52
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,920
He explained to BBC World Service's
The Food Chain how Chinese immigrants

53
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,920
to Japan in the late 1800s
influenced this Japanese dish.

54
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,280
And at one point or another, different
chefs decided to localise these dishes.

55
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,160
They said,
We love these Chinese noodle dishes.

56
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,240
However, why don't we tweak them?

57
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,760
Why don't we make
them a little bit more Japanese?

58
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,280
Frank says that at one point
or another, chefs started to make

59
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,600
noodle dishes more Japanese.

60
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,400
Here, the phrase,
at one point or another,

61
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,760
means at some
unspecified time in the past.

62
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,480
They did this by tweaking
Chinese noodles – in other words,

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,160
by changing them slightly
to make them better, different,

64
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,600
or in this case, more Japanese.

65
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,680
By making these tweaks, adding new
toppings and slices of beef or chicken,

66
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,640
Japanese chefs created the
noodle dish we know today as ramen.

67
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,320
Here's Frank Striegl again, talking with
BBC World Service's The Food Chain.

68
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,680
And what I find fascinating
about ramen,

69
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,520
compared to perhaps other wonderful
noodle dishes around the world,

70
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,000
is that ramen continues to evolve.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,960
Unlike other Japanese foods,
it's OK to push the boundaries.

72
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,920
Frank thinks that Japanese ramen
continues to evolve –

73
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,960
to develop and change gradually

74
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,760
in response
to new developments and ideas.

75
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,720
Unlike other traditional foods
such as sushi,

76
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,960
modern versions of ramen
push the boundaries.

77
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,400
If you push the boundaries,

78
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,640
you act in a way which challenges
normal, acceptable behaviour.

79
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,560
Yes, noodles have changed so much
since ancient times

80
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,200
that today you can buy them dried
in a packet and simply add hot water.

81
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,240
But the flavours and the noodles
themselves maintain a link to the past.

82
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,000
Now, speaking of flavours, what was
the answer to your question, Beth?

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,440
Well, I asked you which region of China
is famous for its spicy flavours.

84
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,640
You were very confident with saying
Sichuan and that is the correct answer.

85
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,000
Sichuan is a place that is famous
for spicy food,

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,840
such as the Sichuan pepper
and Sichuan hotpot.

87
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,000
OK. It's time to recap the vocabulary
we've learnt.

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,280
If you give something a twist,

89
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,800
you change it in some small way
to create something new and exciting.

90
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,160
The adjective exotic means unusual
and exciting

91
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,360
because of coming from far away.

92
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,680
The phrase at one point or another means
at some unspecified time in the past.

93
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,760
If you tweak something, you alter it
slightly in order to improve it.

94
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,520
Something which evolves,
develops and changes gradually.

95
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,280
And finally,
the idiom to push the boundaries

96
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,600
means to do things which challenge
normal, acceptable behaviour.

97
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,520
