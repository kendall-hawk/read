00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,500
And I'm Beth.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,500
Do you enjoy eating noodles, Beth?

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,000
I love noodles, yes. I think my favourite are udon – the big thick ones. Mmm, they're so good!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, some people buy them dried in a packet, others make them fresh from wheat or rice, but there is little doubt that noodles are popular around the world.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
From their origins, probably somewhere in China, noodle recipes were spread by traders on the ancient Silk Road.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
At each destination along the road, people gave noodles a twist, adding different flavours and ingredients to create a new dish.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In this programme, we'll visit the United States and Japan, two countries which have taken noodles and created exciting new varieties.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
As usual, we'll learn some useful new vocabulary, and remember – you can read along with the transcript of this programme, available now on our website.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But first, Neil, I have a question for you.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
As well as different shapes and ingredients, noodles come in many different flavours.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So which region of China is famous for its spicy flavours? Is it: a) Shanghai, b) Sichuan, or c) Guangzhou?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, I think actually, Beth, I know the answer to this. I've been lucky enough to have been to this place.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I think it's b) Sichuan.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
OK. Well, you sound confident. I will reveal the answer later in the programme.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, investigated how noodles spread from Asia through Europe to America.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They uncovered a surprising story: that pasta comes from noodles brought back to Italy by Marco Polo in the 13th century.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Jen Lin-Liu, author of the book 'On the Noodle Road', doesn't believe this story.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So, noodles were very exotic in the 1920s and 30s in the United States...

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
...and there was a new pasta association in America that wanted to promote the manufacturing of dried pasta.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And so they came up with a story about how Marco Polo went to China and found the noodle there...

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
...and brought it all the way to Italy.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
In the 1920s, noodles were popular because they were exotic, meaning foreign, unusual and exciting.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
At that time pasta companies were promoting a new invention, dried pasta, so they came up with a story about Marco Polo to sell more pasta.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If you come up with something, you suggest or think up an idea. And it worked – sales of pasta jumped as a result!

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Now, our second destination, Japan, also has a history of eating noodles.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
One of the most famous Japanese noodle dishes is ramen, and Frank Striegl, a blogger living in Tokyo, knows all about it.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He eats over 300 bowls of ramen a year!

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He explained to BBC World Service's The Food Chain how Chinese immigrants to Japan in the late 1800s influenced this Japanese dish.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And at one point or another, different chefs decided to localise these dishes.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
They said, "We love these Chinese noodle dishes. However, why don't we tweak them? Why don't we make them a little bit more Japanese?"

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Frank says that at one point or another, chefs started to make noodle dishes more Japanese.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Here, the phrase at one point or another means at some unspecified time in the past.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
They did this by tweaking Chinese noodles – in other words, by changing them slightly to make them better, different or, in this case, more Japanese.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
By making these tweaks, adding new toppings and slices of beef or chicken, Japanese chefs created the noodle dish we know today as ramen.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And what I find fascinating about ramen, compared to perhaps other wonderful noodle dishes around the world, is that ramen continues to evolve.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Unlike other Japanese foods, it's OK to push the boundaries.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Frank thinks that Japanese ramen continues to evolve – to develop and change gradually in response to new developments and ideas.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Unlike other traditional food such as sushi, modern versions of ramen push the boundaries.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If you push the boundaries, you act in a way which challenges normal acceptable behaviour.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes, noodles have changed so much since ancient times that today you can buy them dried in a packet and simply add hot water.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But the flavours and the noodles themselves maintain a link to the past.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Now, speaking of flavours, what was the answer to your question, Beth?

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, I asked you which region of China is famous for its spicy flavours.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You were very confident with saying Sichuan and that is the correct answer.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Sichuan is a place that is famous for spicy food, such as the Sichuan pepper and Sichuan hotpot.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
OK. It's time to recap the vocabulary we've learnt.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If you give something a twist, you change it in some small way to create something new and exciting.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The adjective exotic means unusual and exciting because of coming from far away.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The phrase, at one point or another means at some unspecified time in the past.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If you tweak something, you alter it slightly in order to improve it.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Something which evolves, develops and changes gradually.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And finally, the idiom to push the boundaries means to do things which challenge normal acceptable behaviour.
