<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>
<p><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</em></p>

<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="1">Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="2">And I'm Beth.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="3">Do you enjoy eating noodles, Beth?</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="4">I love noodles, yes. I think my favourite are udon – the big thick ones. Mmm, they're so good!</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="5">Well, some people buy them dried in a packet, others make them <span class="glossary-term" data-word="fresh" data-context="default">fresh</span> from wheat or rice, but there is little doubt that noodles are <span class="glossary-term" data-word="popular" data-context="default">popular</span> around the world.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="6">From their <span class="glossary-term" data-word="origins" data-context="default">origins</span>, probably somewhere in China, noodle <span class="glossary-term" data-word="recipes" data-context="default">recipes</span> were <span class="glossary-term" data-word="spread" data-context="default">spread</span> by <span class="glossary-term" data-word="traders" data-context="default">traders</span> on the ancient Silk Road.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="7">At each <span class="glossary-term" data-word="destination" data-context="default">destination</span> along the road, people gave noodles a twist, adding different <span class="glossary-term" data-word="flavour" data-context="default">flavours</span> and <span class="glossary-term" data-word="ingredients" data-context="default">ingredients</span> to create a new dish.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="8">In this programme, we'll visit the United States and Japan, two countries which have taken noodles and created exciting new <span class="glossary-term" data-word="varieties" data-context="default">varieties</span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="9">As usual, we'll learn some useful new vocabulary, and remember – you can read along with the transcript of this programme, available now on our website.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="10">But first, Neil, I have a question for you.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="11">As well as different shapes and <span class="glossary-term" data-word="ingredients" data-context="default">ingredients</span>, noodles come in many different <span class="glossary-term" data-word="flavour" data-context="default">flavours</span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="12">So which region of China is famous for its spicy <span class="glossary-term" data-word="flavour" data-context="default">flavours</span>? Is it: a) Shanghai, b) Sichuan, or c) Guangzhou?</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="13">Well, I think actually, Beth, I know the answer to this. I've been lucky enough to have been to this place.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="14">I think it's b) Sichuan.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="15">OK. Well, you sound confident. I will reveal the answer later in the programme.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="16">BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, <span class="glossary-term" data-word="investigated" data-context="default">investigated</span> how noodles <span class="glossary-term" data-word="spread" data-context="default">spread</span> from Asia through Europe to America.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="17">They <span class="glossary-term" data-word="uncovered" data-context="default">uncovered</span> a surprising story: that pasta comes from noodles brought back to Italy by Marco Polo in the 13th century.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="18">Jen Lin-Liu, author of the book 'On the Noodle Road', doesn't believe this story.</span></p>
<p><strong>Jen Lin-Liu:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="19">So, noodles were very <span class="glossary-term" data-word="exotic" data-context="default">exotic</span> in the 1920s and 30s in the United States...</span></p>
<p><strong>Jen Lin-Liu:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="20">...and there was a new pasta <span class="glossary-term" data-word="association" data-context="default">association</span> in America that wanted to <span class="glossary-term" data-word="promote" data-context="default">promote</span> the <span class="glossary-term" data-word="manufacturing" data-context="default">manufacturing</span> of dried pasta.</span></p>
<p><strong>Jen Lin-Liu:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="21">And so they came up with a story about how Marco Polo went to China and found the noodle there...</span></p>
<p><strong>Jen Lin-Liu:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="22">...and brought it all the way to Italy.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="23">In the 1920s, noodles were <span class="glossary-term" data-word="popular" data-context="default">popular</span> because they were <span class="glossary-term" data-word="exotic" data-context="default">exotic</span>, <span class="glossary-term" data-word="meaning" data-context="default">meaning</span> <span class="glossary-term" data-word="foreign" data-context="default">foreign</span>, unusual and exciting.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="24">At that time pasta companies were promoting a new <span class="glossary-term" data-word="invention" data-context="default">invention</span>, dried pasta, so they came up with a story about Marco Polo to sell more pasta.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="25">If you come up with something, you suggest or think up an idea. And it worked – sales of pasta jumped as a result!</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="26">Now, our second <span class="glossary-term" data-word="destination" data-context="default">destination</span>, Japan, also has a history of eating noodles.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="27">One of the most famous Japanese noodle dishes is ramen, and Frank Striegl, a blogger living in Tokyo, knows all about it.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="28">He eats over 300 bowls of ramen a year!</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="29">He explained to BBC World Service's The Food Chain how Chinese immigrants to Japan in the late 1800s influenced this Japanese dish.</span></p>
<p><strong>Frank Striegl:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="30">And at one point or another, different chefs decided to <span class="glossary-term" data-word="localise" data-context="default">localise</span> these dishes.</span></p>
<p><strong>Frank Striegl:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="31">They said, "We love these Chinese noodle dishes. However, why don't we tweak them? Why don't we make them a little bit more Japanese?"</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="32">Frank says that at one point or another, chefs started to make noodle dishes more Japanese.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="33">Here, the phrase at one point or another means at some <span class="glossary-term" data-word="unspecified" data-context="default">unspecified</span> time in the past.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="34">They did this by tweaking Chinese noodles – in other words, by changing them slightly to make them better, different or, in this case, more Japanese.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="35">By making these tweaks, adding new toppings and <span class="glossary-term" data-word="slices" data-context="default">slices</span> of beef or chicken, Japanese chefs created the noodle dish we know today as ramen.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="36">And what I find fascinating about ramen, compared to perhaps other wonderful noodle dishes around the world, is that ramen continues to evolve.</span></p>
<p><strong>Frank Striegl:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="37">Unlike other Japanese foods, it's OK to push the <span class="glossary-term" data-word="boundaries" data-context="default">boundaries</span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="38">Frank thinks that Japanese ramen continues to evolve – to develop and change <span class="glossary-term" data-word="gradually" data-context="default">gradually</span> in <span class="glossary-term" data-word="response" data-context="default">response</span> to new developments and ideas.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="39">Unlike other <span class="glossary-term" data-word="traditional" data-context="default">traditional</span> food such as sushi, modern versions of ramen push the <span class="glossary-term" data-word="boundaries" data-context="default">boundaries</span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="40">If you push the <span class="glossary-term" data-word="boundaries" data-context="default">boundaries</span>, you act in a way which challenges normal <span class="glossary-term" data-word="acceptable" data-context="default">acceptable</span> behaviour.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="41">Yes, noodles have changed so much since ancient times that today you can buy them dried in a packet and simply add hot water.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="42">But the <span class="glossary-term" data-word="flavour" data-context="default">flavours</span> and the noodles themselves maintain a link to the past.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="43">Now, speaking of <span class="glossary-term" data-word="flavour" data-context="default">flavours</span>, what was the answer to your question, Beth?</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="44">Well, I asked you which region of China is famous for its spicy <span class="glossary-term" data-word="flavour" data-context="default">flavours</span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="45">You were very confident with saying Sichuan and that is the correct answer.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="46">Sichuan is a place that is famous for spicy food, such as the Sichuan pepper and Sichuan hotpot.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="47">OK. It's time to recap the vocabulary we've learnt.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="48">If you give something a twist, you change it in some small way to create something new and exciting.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="49">The adjective <span class="glossary-term" data-word="exotic" data-context="default">exotic</span> means unusual and exciting because of coming from far away.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="50">The phrase, at one point or another means at some <span class="glossary-term" data-word="unspecified" data-context="default">unspecified</span> time in the past.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="51">If you tweak something, you alter it slightly in order to improve it.</span></p>
<p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="52">Something which evolves, develops and changes <span class="glossary-term" data-word="gradually" data-context="default">gradually</span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="53">And finally, the <span class="glossary-term" data-word="idiom" data-context="default">idiom</span> to push the <span class="glossary-term" data-word="boundaries" data-context="default">boundaries</span> means to do things which challenge normal <span class="glossary-term" data-word="acceptable" data-context="default">acceptable</span> behaviour.</span></p>
