    <h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>
    <p><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</em></p>

    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="1">Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="2">And I'm Beth.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="3">Do you enjoy eating noodles, Beth?</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="4">I love noodles, yes.</span>
     <span data-sentence-id="5">I think my favourite are udon – the big thick ones.</span>
    <span data-sentence-id="6">Mmm, they're so good!</span>
    <span data-sentence-id="7">Well, some people buy them dried in a packet,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="8">others make them fresh from wheat or rice,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="9">but there is little doubt that noodles are popular around the world.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="10">From their origins, probably somewhere in China,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="11">noodle recipes were spread by traders on the ancient Silk Road.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="12">At each destination along the road, people gave noodles a twist,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="13">adding different flavours and ingredients to create a new dish.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="14">In this programme, we'll visit the United States and Japan,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="15">two countries which have taken noodles and created exciting new varieties.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="16">As usual, we'll learn some useful new vocabulary</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="17">and remember – you can read along with the transcript of this programme,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="18">available now on our website, bbclearningenglish.com</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="19">But first, Neil, I have a question for you.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="20">As well as different shapes and ingredients,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="21">noodles come in many different flavours.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="22">So, which region of China is famous for its spicy flavours?</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="23">Is it: a) Shanghai, b) Sichuan, or c) Guangzhou?</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="24">Well, I think actually, Beth, I know the answer to this.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="25">I've been lucky enough to have been to this place.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="26">I think it's b) Sichuan.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="27">OK. Well, you sound confident.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="28">I will reveal the answer later in the programme.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="29">BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="30">investigated how noodles spread from Asia through Europe to America.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="31">They uncovered a surprising story that pasta comes</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="32">from noodles brought back to Italy by Marco Polo in the 13th century.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="33">Jen Lin-Liu, author of the book,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="34">On the Noodle Road, doesn't believe this story.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Jen Lin-Liu:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="35">So, noodles were very exotic in the 1920s and 30s in the United States,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Jen Lin-Liu:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="36">and there was a new pasta association in America</span></p>
    <p><strong>Jen Lin-Liu:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="37">that wanted to promote the manufacturing of dried pasta.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Jen Lin-Liu:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="38">And so they came up with a story</span></p>
    <p><strong>Jen Lin-Liu:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="39">about how Marco Polo went to China</span></p>
    <p><strong>Jen Lin-Liu:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="40">and found the noodle there,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Jen Lin-Liu:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="41">and brought it all the way to Italy.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="42">In the 1920s, noodles were popular because they were exotic,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="43">meaning foreign, unusual and exciting.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="44">At that time, pasta companies were promoting a new invention, dried pasta,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="45">so they came up with a story about Marco Polo to sell more pasta.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="46">If you come up with something you suggest or think up an idea.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="47">And it worked – sales of pasta jumped as a result!</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="48">Now, our second destination, Japan, also has a history of eating noodles.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="49">One of the most famous Japanese noodle dishes is ramen,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="50">and Frank Striegl, a blogger living in Tokyo, knows all about it.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="51">He eats over 300 bowls of ramen a year!</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="52">He explained to BBC World Service's The Food Chain how Chinese immigrants</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="53">to Japan in the late 1800s influenced this Japanese dish.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Frank Striegl:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="54">And at one point or another, different chefs decided to localise these dishes.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Frank Striegl:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="55">They said, We love these Chinese noodle dishes.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Frank Striegl:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="56">However, why don't we tweak them?</span></p>
    <p><strong>Frank Striegl:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="57">Why don't we make them a little bit more Japanese?</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="58">Frank says that at one point or another, chefs started to make</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="59">noodle dishes more Japanese.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="60">Here, the phrase, at one point or another,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="61">means at some unspecified time in the past.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="62">They did this by tweaking Chinese noodles – in other words,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="63">by changing them slightly to make them better, different,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="64">or in this case, more Japanese.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="65">By making these tweaks, adding new toppings and slices of beef or chicken,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="66">Japanese chefs created the noodle dish we know today as ramen.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="67">Here's Frank Striegl again, talking with BBC World Service's The Food Chain.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Frank Striegl:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="68">And what I find fascinating about ramen,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Frank Striegl:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="69">compared to perhaps other wonderful noodle dishes around the world,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Frank Striegl:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="70">is that ramen continues to evolve.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="71">Unlike other Japanese foods, it's OK to push the boundaries.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="72">Frank thinks that Japanese ramen continues to evolve –</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="73">to develop and change gradually</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="74">in response to new developments and ideas.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="75">Unlike other traditional foods such as sushi,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="76">modern versions of ramen push the boundaries.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="77">If you push the boundaries,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="78">you act in a way which challenges normal, acceptable behaviour.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="79">Yes, noodles have changed so much since ancient times</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="80">that today you can buy them dried in a packet and simply add hot water.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="81">But the flavours and the noodles themselves maintain a link to the past.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="82">Now, speaking of flavours, what was the answer to your question, Beth?</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="83">Well, I asked you which region of China is famous for its spicy flavours.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="84">You were very confident with saying Sichuan and that is the correct answer.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="85">Sichuan is a place that is famous for spicy food,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="86">such as the Sichuan pepper and Sichuan hotpot.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="87">OK. It's time to recap the vocabulary we've learnt.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="88">If you give something a twist,</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="89">you change it in some small way to create something new and exciting.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="90">The adjective exotic means unusual and exciting</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="91">because of coming from far away.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="92">The phrase at one point or another means at some unspecified time in the past.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="93">If you tweak something, you alter it slightly in order to improve it.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Beth:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="94">Something which evolves, develops and changes gradually.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="95">And finally, the idiom to push the boundaries</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="96">means to do things which challenge normal, acceptable behaviour.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Neil:</strong> <span data-sentence-id="97">Once again, our six minutes are up.</span></p>
